### Theoretical Framework

1. **Category Theory as a Guiding Principle**:
   - **Objects**: Define each Ansible role as an object, representing a specific state or configuration in your system.
   - **Morphisms (States)**: Consider each state (including `info`) as a morphism, a transformation or action. The `info` state acts as an identity morphism, reflecting the current state without altering it.
   - **Functors**: View the transition from one role's output to another's input as functors, mapping between these categories. The `info` state helps in understanding the output (current state) of one functor before it's inputted into another.

### Design Guidelines

1. **Consistency Across Roles**:

   - Ensure every role has an `info` state that performs a standard set of operations: gathering current configurations, checking the status, and providing insights into the role’s effect on the system.
   - This state should be able to collate data that can be used by other roles, acting as a foundational layer for more complex interactions.

2. **Information Gathering and Presentation**:
   - The `info` state should be comprehensive in its data collection, ensuring all relevant information about the role's current state is captured.
   - The presentation of this information should be clear, concise, and structured in a way that is easily consumable by other roles and by system administrators.

### Justification for Development Steps

1. **Enhanced Debugging and System Insights**:

   - By having a robust `info` state, you simplify the process of debugging and understanding the system's current configuration. This is crucial for complex orchestrations where interdependencies are significant.
   - This approach aligns with self-documenting practices, making the system more maintainable and understandable.

2. **Foundation for Future Extensions**:

   - Establishing a well-defined `info` state sets the groundwork for future expansions and integrations. Knowing the precise state of each component allows for safer and more predictable modifications and enhancements.

3. **Streamlined Development Process**:
   - With a clear theoretical and practical guideline, developers can easily understand their role in the project and how their contributions fit into the larger picture. This reduces the learning curve and accelerates the development process.

### Next Steps in Development

1. **Implement and Refine `info` States**: Begin by implementing or refining the `info` state in each role, focusing on data collection and presentation.

2. **Integration Testing**: Test how the `info` state from one role integrates with other roles. For example, how does the `info` output of the `luks` role influence the behavior of the `btrfs_subvolumes` role?

3. **Documentation and Examples**: Document each role’s `info` state comprehensively, including examples of its output and how this output can be utilized by other roles or for system insights.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Create a feedback mechanism for each implementation of the `info` state. This could be in the form of automated tests or peer reviews to ensure the output is consistent with the design principles.
