### Expected Variables (Objects)

The role uses the following structure for input variables:

- `luks_name`: The human friendly description of the LUKS volume.
- `luks_path`: The system path to the LUKS volume.
- `luks_keyfile`: The file path to the LUKS key.
- `luks_device_name`: The the name used by the device mapper to provide an alias to the contents of the LUKS encrypted block device. It is used to uniquely identify the LUKS volume on the system and is typically found at `/dev/mapper/<luks_device_name>`. Ensure that the `luks_device_name` does not conflict with existing device mapper entries on the target system.

### Role Behavior (Morphisms)

Depending on the `state` variable provided, the role will apply different transitions:

- `present`: Initializes and validates the LUKS volume configuration.
- `started`: Opens the LUKS volume, making it ready for use. (Todo: Not yet implemented)
- `stopped`: Closes the LUKS volume, ensuring it's not in use. (Todo: Not yet implemented)
- `absent`: Removes the LUKS volume configuration. (Todo: Not yet implemented)

## Example Playbook

```yaml
- name: Manage LUKS Volumes
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: luks
      vars:
        luks_name: "secure_volume"
        luks_path: "/dev/sdx"
        luks_keyfile: "/path/to/keyfile"
        state: "present"
```

## Tasks Explanation

1. **Manage LUKS Keys and Containers:**
   - Invokes the LUKS Key Management role, performing tasks such as generating, adding, and managing LUKS keys, as well as creating, opening, and closing LUKS containers based on the provided configurations.

## Usage

1. Include the LUKS Key Management role in your playbook.
2. Set the required variables in the playbook or use external variable files.
3. Run the playbook to manage LUKS keys and containers based on the provided configurations.

## Note

This role assumes that the target system has LUKS-enabled devices. Ensure that the required packages and dependencies are installed before executing this role. (TODO: Add dependencies)

## Recommendations

It is recommended to store LUKS keys securely, considering the sensitivity of encryption keys. Utilize vaults or secure storage mechanisms to protect LUKS keys from unauthorized access.
